                    These events are not caused by humans but rather forces of nature

                    eventually culminated in a dike breach along Lake Gaoyou on 25 August 1931.

                What is an earthquake by definition?
                <br>
                <br>
                An earthquake is the sudden shaking of the ground caused by the movement of rock beneath the Earth's

                surface. This movement typically happens along faults (cracks in the Earth's crust) when stress builds

                up and is suddenly released as seismic energy. Usually caused by the movement of the tectonic plate.

                <br>
                A flood is the overflow of water onto normally dry land. It occurs when a body of water, like a river or
                stream, overflows its banks, or when surface water accumulates in areas that are typically dry. Flooding
                can be caused by various factors, including heavy rainfall, rapid snowmelt, storm surges, and dam or
                levee failures.

                <br>
                A wildfire is a fire that spreads uncontrolled through areas of natural vegetation like forests,
                grasslands, and brushlands. It can be caused by natural events like lightning or human actions like
                careless disposal of cigarettes. Wildfires can be incredibly destructive, impacting both the environment
                and human populations.

                A landslide is defined as the movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth down a slope. Landslides are
